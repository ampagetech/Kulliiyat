    Kulliyatul Banat is a faith-based Girls college meant to provide affordable good quality modern and religious education to the women folks. The school is sex-biased to promote and improve the educative quality of both students and teachers who could otherwise be denied such opportunity in mixed schools because of fear -dictated by modesty â€“ of the moral decadence that has permeated the education sector in the country and even world at large.
